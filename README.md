# GW2-CommandersToolkit
A simple arcdps module that tracks squad members, so that you can check if someone left the party what they were responsible for.

# Usage
When someone joins your squad simply tick off what they're responsible for and set their subgroup.
This way you can see whether Subgroup X has the main boons, as well as Heal and Vulnerability covered.
You can also write down a quick note, to remind yourself for example who will later do Handkite or Pylon.

# Limitations
Subgroups have to be manually set for each user, as they are exposed by arc when entering a combat or when changing the instance.
